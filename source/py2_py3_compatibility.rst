Python 2 and Python 3 compatibility
===================================

The both Python 2 and Python 3 codes of the same software will be required for some time. There can be used two strategies how to cover the requirement:

1. Separate branches for Python 2 and Python 3

   This strategy makes porting easier. It can be automated by porting tools. There are also avoided compatibility issues between the both Python major releases in the same source code. However, it is more complicated to maintain and develop two separate branches.

2. One source code compatible with Python 2 and Python 3

   The strategy can be preferred, if there is required to avoid development and maintenance of two separated branches in Python 2 and Python 3. In this case, the porting will require more investment to keep the compatibility with the both major releases, and also to drop compatibility with Python 2.5 and lower versions.


Libraries
---------

``modernize`` and other tools are able to cover mostly changes related to reorganizations and renamings of libraries in Python 3 by using ``six`` module. Another way is to avoid `six`` module and try to import libraries from one location, and if ``ImportError`` occurs, then import from the other location. Regebro's book, `Supporting Python 3 <http://python3porting.com/stdlib.html>`_, describes principles, how the libraries reorganizations can be solved in the source code. Some additional examples are here:

Original Python 2 code::

    from StringIO import StringIO

Python 3 code::

    from io import StringIO

Final code compatible with Python 2 and Python 3::

    # Try Python 2 import; if ImportError occurs, use Python 3 import
    try:
        from StringIO import StringIO
    except ImportError:
        from io import StringIO

There can be other case where can be used a similare solution:

Original Python 2 code::

    from mock import Mock

Python 3 code::

    from unittest.mock import Mock

Final code compatible with Python 2 and Python 3 where is reversed the order of versions::

    # Try Python 3 import; if ImportError occurs, use Python 2 import
    try:
        from unittest.mock import Mock
    except ImportError:
        from mock import Mock

Other cases can be fixed by following way:

Original Python 2 code::

    from nose.tools import assert_items_equal

``assert_items_equal`` was replaced by ``assert_count_equal``, so the code should be in Python 3::

    from nose.tools import assert_count_equal

and changes from ``assert_count_equal`` to ``assert_items_equal`` in the source code.

Final code compatible with Python 2 and Python 3 where the original ``assert_count_equal`` usage is kept without any change in the source code::

    # Try Python 2 import; if ImportError occurs, use Python 3 import
    try:
        from nose.tools import assert_items_equal
    except ImportError:
        from nose.tools import assert_count_equal as assert_items_equal


String representation
---------------------

The different string representation is challenging for porting from Python 2 to Python 3. Several functions that return binary data, return ``str`` type in Python 2 and ``bytes`` in Python 3. An example is described in `Supporting Python 3 <http://http://python3porting.com/problems.html#string-representation>`_, other one is following.

Original Python 2 code, where ``content`` is binary data representing text::

    def parse_data(content):
        for line in content.split('\n'):
            ...
        return

As ``content`` is ``str`` type in Python 2 and ``bytes`` in Python 3, the code needs to be adjusted to be compatible in teh both Python versions::

    def parse_data(content):
        if isinstance(content, str):
            output = content
        else:
            output = bytes.decode(content)
        for line in output.split('\n'):
            ...
        return

There can be also a case when the original Python 2 code handles transparently text data of ``str`` type with characters > 127. Python 3 works with such ``str`` type data in the different way because of internal Unicode coding, so the source code compatible with Python 2 and Python 3 has to distinguish between the both situations as illustrated in a following example:

Original code::

    import os
    
    def atomic_write(filename, content):
        file_handle = os.open(filename, os.O_RDWR | os.O_CREAT | os.O_EXCL, 0600)
        os.write(file_handle, content)
        os.close(file_handle)

Adjusted code::

    import os, sys
    
    def atomic_write(filename, content):
        file_handle = os.open(filename, os.O_RDWR | os.O_CREAT | os.O_EXCL, 0o600)
        if sys.version_info > (3,):
            os.write(file_handle, content.encode())
        else:
            os.write(file_handle, content)
        os.close(file_handle)
